Bitnation is a distributed governance project. They are providing their open-source, blockchain ID and Bitcoin debit cards to refugees. This provides refugees the ability to access crucial services. For example, access to a notarization of official documents could mean life or death to some refugees.

The nation of Estonia is beta testing a program called e-Residency as part of their economic national strategy. e-Residency provides many government services to people from other nations who apply. e-Residents receive an official e-Resident ID for banking, contracts, or registering a business.

Bitnation is working with the e-Residency program to provide these services to refugees. They will use these services for proof of marriage, birth certificates, and to transfer funds.

Sussane Tarkowski Tempelhof is the CEO of Bitnation. She shares the vision of a border-less world. She points out how our political lines-in-the-sand cause suffering. Case in point, war torn areas in the Middle East due to colonially imposed borders.

In the deal with Estonia, Bitnation becomes an internationally recognized independent entity. These are small steps for the people involved but giant strides for mankind.
